# Social-Distance-Analyzer
Social distancing is deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness. Staying at least six feet away from other people lessens your chances of catching COVID-19. We can use OpenCV and YOLO to monitor/analyze whether people are maintaining social distancing or not.
